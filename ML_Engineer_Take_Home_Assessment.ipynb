        "- You will be given 6 hours at max to complete this assessment\n",
        "- You need to use Google Collaboratory to run this notebook\n",
        "- You can only use Python as a programming Language\n",
        "- Once you start you have to complete this assessment in those 6 hours, it cannot be paused and resumed later\n",
        "- You cannot take help from any other person\n",
        "- You can use Google to search for references\n",
        "- You can not search on google for design-related things, like what should be loss function, or what should be model architecture.\n",
        "  - But you can use pre-trained backbones from PyTorch\n",
        "- [NO SUBMISSION WILL BE ACCEPTED WITHOUT THESE VIDEOS] Record videos for the whole duration of the assessment:\n",
        "  - Make sure you start screen recording before starting the assessment and submit the screen recording link after you are done with the assessment\n",
        "    - Make sure to add a detailed walk-through of the codebase you have developed in the screen recording\n",
        "      - Sharing implementation details, giving a full overview of the codebase\n",

        "  - You can use any backbone\n",
        "    - Either from PyTorch (torhvision) or any resource online\n",
        "    - But you need to design head your self (head means how you will use features of the back bone and get the desired outputs)\n",
        "  - Model needs to detect one object in each image\n",
        "  - Model should output following for each image passed as input:\n",
        "    - Whether we have an object or not\n",
        "    - Where is the object?\n",
        "      - The bounding box output format should be xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax\n",
        "      - It is not necessary the model is trained to output exactly this format but the visualize function which shows output should output in this format\n",
        "    - Either the object is a cat or dog?\n",

        "  - There are many scenarios which you need to handle, which one can understand from the dataset details and the model design\n",
        "- Implement Test Function\n",
        "  - The test function should be able to run the model on the validation set and output the metrics for all the outputs of the model\n",
        "  - Select the metrics carefully, there are many scenarios which can change the selection of a metric\n",
        "  - Keep in mind there are multiple outputs, you would need a metric for each output\n",
        "- Update Resume Training Functionality using the best weights\n",
        "  - Current script does not have best weights save functionality\n",
        "  - The code should be able to resume training from exactly same point from where the training was stopped if model weights file is passed\n",

        "- Implement a visualize function\n",

        "  - Values of the returned dictionary should be like explained above and keys should be image names including the extension \".jpg\" or \".jpeg\"\n",
        "  - Should save output image with bounding box drawn on it, with same name input image but place in the output folder \n",
        "- Implement Test Cases to Test Different Functions Written\n",

        "  - Model should not be designed in a way that it can only accept a fixed input size.\n",
        "- Any Updates in the notebook (Bugs/Implementation Mistakes etc)\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to submit\n",
