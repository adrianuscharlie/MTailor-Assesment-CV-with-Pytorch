        "- We expect it to take ~4 hours, with an extra 15 min for clear loom explanation(s)\n",
        "  - The assessment is timeboxed at 5 hours total in a single block. So please plan accordingly\n",
        "- You need to use Google Collaboratory to run and edit this notebook\n",
        "- You can only use Python as a programming Language\n",
        "- You cannot take help from any other person\n",
        "- You can use Google to search for references\n",
        "- You can not search on google for design-related things, like what should be loss function, or what should be model architecture.\n",
        "  - But you can use pre-trained backbones from PyTorch\n",
        "- Record a 5-10 mins of code walkthrough of the work you have done. You can use Loom Platform (https://www.loom.com) to record the video.\n",

        "    - Either from PyTorch (torhvision) or any resource online\n",

        "  - Model needs to detect one object in each image\n",

        "    - Where is the object?\n",
        "      - The bounding box output format should be xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax\n",
        "      - It is not necessary the model is trained to output exactly this format but the visualize function which shows output should output in this format\n",
        "    - Either the object is a cat or dog?\n",

        "  - Select the metrics carefully, there are many scenarios which can change the selection of a metric\n",
        "  - Keep in mind there are multiple outputs, you would need a metric for each output\n",
        "  - [NOTE] You don't need to implement metrics for the bounding box output as it can take more time than provided for this assessment. But please add details of the metrics you would have implemented in your code-walk through loom video.\n",
        "- Update Resume Training Functionality using the best weights\n",
        "  - Current script does not have save best weights functionality\n",
        "  - The code should be able to resume training from exactly same point from where the training was stopped if model weights file is passed\n",

        "- Implement a visualize function [Most important, without this no submission will be accepted]\n",
